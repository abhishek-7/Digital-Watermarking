# Digital-Watermarking

The project aims to hide a watermark inside a dataset by embedding the points lying on the line in the dataset. This is achieved by man

Used Java , AES Encryption Algorithm , IEEE 754 format for floating point numbers

The least significant bit watermarking algorithm involves embedding the watermark in the least significant bits of the cover object.

* Embedding the watermark
The Primary key of the database was encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard , and the watermark was placed in predetermined columns of the tuples wherein the encrypted primary key was a multiple of Î±.

* Extracting and validating the watermark
On the same database, a decrypting algorithm was run and the points extracted. False Acceptance Calculated  ~ 13%; Graph Plotted

* Insertion Attacks
Tuples without having the embedded watermark were added to the database , Readings plotted for various insertion intensities-10% , 20% upto 100%.

* Updation Attacks
Tuples within the database were modified. Readings plotted for various updation intensities- 10%,20%, upto 100% updation

* Deletion Attacks
Tuples within the database were modified. Readings plotted for various deletion intensities- 10%,20%, upto 90% deletion of tuples
